The removal of pressures in goods and labour markets, together with falling asset prices, should see further progress on the underlying inflation rate. On the other hand, the recent increase in oil prices will contribute to a once-and-for-all rise in the price level; we will all need to be vigilant to prevent this from feeding into the underlying inflation rate.\n\nDomestic spending and activity have declined further and are likely to remain weak for some time yet. Retail trade has been flat, investment has fallen, and employment also is now falling. Import volumes are now about 10 per cent below their peak. Credit continues to grow at a moderate pace, as it has since the beginning of 1990.\n\nThis further reduction in cash rates is expected to flow through quickly and fully to banks' indicator lending rates."}
